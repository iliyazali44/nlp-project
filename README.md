# twitter data sentiment analysis
### Overview

After learning different applications of **NLP** during my course study. I got to know text mining is one of the major application and that is the reason I've chosen twitter sentiment analysis.
Let's deep dive into the process/steps and core advantage of using this technique. In this blog I am going to describe about how can we get or extract the live twitter data and perform data preprocessing ,apply sentiment analysis and training the model by different Machine Learning algorithms.


### Steps to be followed:
1. create the twitter developer account
2. scrape the live data from twitter
3. Preprocess the data
4. Analysis and getting insights from data
5. Train the model with the cleaned data
